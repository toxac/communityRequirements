# P2P Community Marketplace

Peer-to-peer marketplaces, on the other hand, offer a platform for both sellers and buyers. And, most importantly, users can play both roles: a seller can become a buyer and a buyer can sell something. The two roles are equal and easy to switch between. Hence, the name peer-to-peer.

## Transactions
- With classified websites, transactions typically take place off the platform via a channel mutually agreed by the seller and buyer.
- P2P marketplaces are like going to a market — you see a product you want, you pay for it right then and there, and you have it delivered to you.
- Peer to peer marketplaces offer tools to facilitate the buying process, including a means to pay for products and services.
- Marketplace owners should carefully select a payment gateway, as they'll be responsible for how it works.

## Monetization

Just as classified websites do, marketplaces usually charge sellers, not buyers.

Most classified websites offer premium listings as their business model; others use ads (some combine the two). It’s also possible to use a pay-per-click model or implement limits for free accounts. All these monetization methods are used on P2P marketplaces. But usually, marketplaces charge fees:

- For listings
- For sales
- For currency conversions
- Depending on the niche, there might be other fees.
